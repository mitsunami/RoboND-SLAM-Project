# RoboND-SLAM-Project
This project is for mapping a world with SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm and generation of a new environment for the algorithm by developing a ROS package. original map is generated in Gazebo, that would allow the robot to map itself in a particular map. RTAB-Map (Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping) is used as a SLAM algorithm to develop a robot which can map environments in both 2D and 3D
